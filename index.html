                <p>
                    I am a passionate software developer currently studying at School 42 in Angoulême, France. 
                    My journey in programming began with C, where I developed a strong foundation. 
                    I have worked on various projects, including a basic shell implementation (Minishell) 
                    and a real-time chat application in C++. My interests extend to web technologies, 
                    and I'm currently exploring Python, JavaScript, and assembly language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I have experience in sales and customer service, 
                    which has enhanced my communication abilities. I am also diving into new areas such as 
                    personal finance management and freelancing opportunities. My goal is to expand my skillset 
                    and contribute effectively to innovative projects in software development.
